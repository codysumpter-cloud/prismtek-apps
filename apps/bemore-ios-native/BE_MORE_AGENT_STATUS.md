# BeMoreAgent native iOS status

This file summarizes the current truthful state of the iOS shell on `master`.

## Current source of truth

The native app lives in:

- `apps/openclaw-shell-ios`

Current shipped shell surfaces include:

- first-run onboarding with persisted stack config
- Mission Control as the post-onboarding landing surface
- Models as the route-control surface for local and cloud selection
- Chat, Skills, Artifacts, Buddy, Files, and Settings tabs
- `.bemore/` workspace artifacts, JSON state stores, action/event logs, and a skills registry
- Pokémon Team Builder as a registry-backed skill that saves JSON and Markdown artifacts
- ClawHub local starter-skill installs that persist manifest and README artifacts
- editable/exportable/deletable Files workspace entries and `.bemore` artifacts
- persisted tab ordering and visibility
- bundled Council Starter Pack Buddy templates with local install flow
- persisted Buddy library state, runtime events, active selection, and personalization
- receipt-backed Buddy check-ins/training that regenerate `.bemore/buddy.md` and `.bemore/buddies.md`
- bundled repo-backed surface briefs inside Mission Control

## Important current behavior

- First launch routes into onboarding until `stackConfig.isOnboardingComplete` becomes true.
- Relaunch returns to the main tab shell after onboarding is complete.
- The local runtime is still stubbed unless `MLCSwift` is actually present and wired.
- Cloud routes can be configured in Settings and switched in Models.
- Workspace actions run through BeMore runtime receipts. The UI should not claim files, memory,
  skills, or sandbox work completed unless the runtime returns a completed or persisted receipt.
- Buddy install/personalize/check-in/training actions also run through BeMore runtime receipts and
  should not claim continuity updates unless the receipt persisted the Buddy bundle artifacts.
- Cloud/local replies are sanitized before display so hidden reasoning/thought blocks are not shown
  unless the operator explicitly asks for an explanation.
- The iOS sandbox currently exposes controlled BeMore commands (`pwd`, `ls`, `cat`, `write`, `regenerate`,
  `skills`, `help`) rather than arbitrary host shell execution.

## Local build path

```bash
cd apps/openclaw-shell-ios
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project BeMoreAgent.xcodeproj \
  -scheme BeMoreAgent \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData \
  build
```

## Release path

- `CFBundleVersion` is currently `19` because App Store Connect already has build `18` and rejects duplicate uploads.
- `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is currently `26.0`.
- TestFlight delivery is repo-managed through `.github/workflows/testflight.yml`.
- The operator runbook for that path is `apps/openclaw-shell-ios/ADMIN_TESTFLIGHT_RUNBOOK.md`.
- Xcode Cloud is not the required release path for this target right now.

## Honest limits

- `BeMoreAgentShellApp.swift` still boots `AppState(engine: MLCBridgeEngine())`.
- `project.yml` still has `dependencies: []`.
- When `MLCSwift` is not importable, the app still uses the stub local-runtime path and cannot claim
  real on-device inference.
- Arbitrary codex-style shell/process execution is not available on-device in this build. Build 19
  provides a receipt-backed controlled sandbox surface and leaves real hardened process execution for
  a future platform/runtime integration.
- Buddy Workshop authoring, external package publishing, and marketplace flows are not shipped in
  this wedge; the source of truth is the bundled canonical starter pack inside `BeMore-stack`.

## Next native work

1. keep the shell truth and docs aligned with what is actually shipped
2. preserve simulator build + relaunch verification on every PR
3. only land local-runtime work as a separate PR if it is real on-device inference, not a stub
4. deepen Buddy progression/UI only after the starter-pack install and continuity path stay green
5. expand Pokémon Team Builder with simulator/type data once a bundled dataset is selected
