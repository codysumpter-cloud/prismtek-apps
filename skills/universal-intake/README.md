description: Read arbitrary user-provided links/files/media with best-effort fallbacks (web fetch, browser relay, yt-dlp, ffmpeg keyframes), then return actionable summaries and blockers. Use when a user says "read/watch this link" or provides media/assets for analysis.

# Universal Intake

## Purpose
Provide a consistent interface for reading and analyzing user-provided links, files, and media (especially videos) with automatic fallbacks when direct access is blocked or unavailable.

Use this when a user shares a link, file, or video and wants analysis, summary, or key information extracted.

## Workflow

1. Try direct fetch first (`web_fetch`).
2. If blocked/auth-gated, use browser relay path (requires paired/attached browser tab).
3. For videos, run `scripts/extract_video_keyframes.sh <file-or-url>`.
4. Summarize with:
   - verdict
   - key points
   - timestamped highlights (if video)
   - concrete next actions
   - confidence + blockers

## Guardrails

- Never claim full access if link is auth/captcha-gated.
- Explicitly state what was accessible and what was blocked.
- Keep user-facing output practical and blunt.

## Scripts

- `scripts/extract_video_keyframes.sh` — probes media and extracts 1fps frames for quick review.
- `scripts/fetch_any_link.sh` — tries web fetch + yt-dlp metadata as fallback.

## Smoke Test
Verify end-to-end function:
\`\`\`bash
# Test with a URL
./skills/universal-intake/scripts/fetch_any_link.sh \"https://example.com\" ./test-output
# Expect: fetched content in test-output/

# Test with local file
./skills/universal-intake/scripts/fetch_any_link.sh \${PWD}/SKILL.md ./test-output
# Expect: SKILL.md copied to test-output/

# Test YouTube metadata
./skills/universal-intake/scripts/fetch_any_link.sh \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw\" ./test-output
# Expect: metadata.json in test-output/
\`\`\`
Dependencies: yt-dlp, ffmpeg (for keyframes)
